# Align every SDK to propose the same functionality, security and quality
 
## Instructions

- make sure every SDK has identical (the Java SDK being the source of truth): 
  - functionality
  - structure
  - concepts
  - security
  - documentation
  - quality
- read every file, be systematic, do not skip anything
- systemically compare the source code
- show the report 
- for each misalignment, propose a plan
- after implementing the plan, update docs/SDK_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md
